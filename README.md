# android-repository

This is a set of scripts for creating a mirror of Android Repository where SDK Manager downloads SDK packages.

Tested on 

* Linux Mint Maya(13, Ubuntu 10.04)/Rebecca(17.1, Ubuntu 14.04),
* OS X Yosemite (10.10.4)
* Cygwin on Windows 7 64bit

You'll need at least 30GB free storage on your disk.

## OS X

It's recommended to use homebrew to install wget.
